# Easy Canadian Tech Applications

## Looking for a job?
Are you a Canadian? Do you want to work in tech but don't want to leave the beautiful great white north, eh? Then this list is for you!

Have you ever tried to apply for a company only to discover they want you to either make account just so you can apply for one of their jobs or they won't let you upload your resume? Instead you have to manually fill out page after page of questions, where all of the answers can be found on the resume you spend hours making.

This is a list of companies that are either Canadian or have offices in Canada and are easy to apply to. These companies use a job application system that allows you to focus on presenting your best application possible rather then spend your time and energy fighting bad UX design. If the company uses a system that requires the you to manually input every field from your resume they are not allowed on this list.

## A Tip of Advice / Word of Warning
Please note that I do not encouraged or suggest that you apply blindly to every company on this list. I made this list while I was looking for possible jobs in Canada and because I fell like the application process of a company is a reflection of the culture of that company. Every link on this list is to either the company's main career page or company's main page so that you can spend some time learning about the company and making sure your a good fit before applying.

Happy job hunting fellow canadians
